    title: 'Simple Tomato Soup',
    description: "This is my go-to tomato soup recipe. It's so easy and delicious. It's easily made vegan (if you use margarine instead of butter or 2 tablespoons of olive oil), ready in 30 minutes, and I give leftovers to my kids for lunch. If you like, you can add cream, but my family likes it the way it is. I usually serve it with rosemary bread for dunking.",

    title: 'Cedar Planked Salmon',

    text: "Loved this! True to it's name...EASY! Only changes: Used 3 Granny Smith apples & added a few drops of lemon juice, 1/2C of pecans (no raisins) and sugared the pastry before adding the apples. Brushed pastry after it was rolled with melted butter and then sugar. Seems like a lot of sugar but the apples I used were pretty tart and needed it. (And we aren't hugh sweet eaters.) Mine have cooked in about 12-15 min...maybe it's just my oven, but I would watch to make sure not to burn bottoms. VERY, VERY GOOD & EAS",

    text: "My boyfriend said this was the best piece of fish he's ever had! I soaked the cedar for about 7 hours then oiled one side. I used a 2.5 lb piece of salmon skin side down. I heated the plank and then put the fish on for 20 minutes, then turned off the heat and kept it on the grill for about 5 more minutes before serving.",
